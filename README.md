  <h1 align="center">Friday Night Funkin': Forever Engine [ARCHIVE]</h1>
</p>

-----------------------------------------------------
Due to recent events, [Yoshubs / CubicYoshi](https://github.com/Yoshubs)'s github account has been deleted

in order to preserve her hard work on this project, [I, Gabriela](https://github.com/BeastlyGabi) have archived the files for all versions of Forever Engine I had saved on separate repositories.

* [Legacy](https://github.com/BeastlyGabi/Funkin-Forever-Engine/tree/legacy)
* [1.0 (UNFINISHED)](https://github.com/BeastlyGabi/Funkin-Forever-Engine/tree/rewrite)
* [Hybrid](https://github.com/BeastlyGabi/Funkin-Forever-Engine/tree/hybrid)

**thank you for your effort Cubii, and stay safe.**

~ **Sincerely, BeastlyGhost**
